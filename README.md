<h1>Beta Airlines</h1>
This website was created with ASP.NET MVC using C#. <br>
This connects to a Microsoft SQL database that stores the user, flight, and message data.<br>
There are 3 separate user access roles, applying the appropriate restrictions for each. (General, Manager, and Admin)<br>
The administrator would have the ability to add more roles and have full access to setting up flights, airports, users, etc.<br>
The manager has limited administrative privileges, but are able to manage users and messages that come in through the contact form. <br>
Users with General access are limited to just being able to book a flight and see their own flights that they have booked already. <br>
